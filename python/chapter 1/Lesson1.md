## 🧠 What is Python?

Python is a **high-level, general-purpose programming language** — designed
to be easy for humans to read and write, and powerful enough to build
almost anything: websites, games, robots, AI systems, and more.

Unlike older languages that look like machine instructions, Python reads
almost like plain English. That is not an accident — it was designed
that way on purpose.

!!! quote "The Philosophy"
    *"Beautiful is better than ugly. Simple is better than complex.
    Readability counts."*

    — Tim Peters, The Zen of Python (`import this`)

---

## 🕰️ History & Development

### The Origin Story

In the late 1980s, a Dutch programmer named **Guido van Rossum** was
working at a research institute in the Netherlands called CWI. He worked
with a language called ABC but found it too limiting.

During the **Christmas holiday of 1989**, with time on his hands, he
started building something new — a language that fixed ABC's problems
and was genuinely enjoyable to use.

!!! info "Why the name Python?"
    Guido was a fan of **Monty Python's Flying Circus** — a British
    comedy show. The name has nothing to do with the snake. 🎭

    He later wrote: *"I chose Python as a working title, being in a
    slightly irreverent mood."*

### Timeline

    title Python — From Idea to Number 1 Language
    1989 : Guido van Rossum starts Python over Christmas holiday
    1991 : Python 0.9.0 — first public release to the world
    1994 : Python 1.0 — lambda · map · filter added
    2000 : Python 2.0 — list comprehensions · garbage collection
    2008 : Python 3.0 — major redesign · cleaner syntax
    2020 : Python 2 officially retired forever
    2023 : Python becomes the number 1 language globally
```

!!! warning "Always use Python 3"
    Python 2 was retired in 2020. It receives **no updates and no
    security fixes**. Never start a new project in Python 2.


### The Philosophy Behind Python

Guido had a clear vision: Python should be simple, readable, and fun.
He captured this in **The Zen of Python** — a set of guiding principles.
Read them anytime by typing this into Python:

```python
import this
```

The most important lines:

- *"Beautiful is better than ugly."*
- *"Simple is better than complex."*
- *"Readability counts."*

## 💻 Choosing Your Editor

Before writing Python, you need a place to write and run it.
An **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** is that place —
think of it like a fully equipped kitchen for coding.

!!! tip "Which should I use?"
    - Use **Replit** if you want to start in the next 2 minutes
    - Use **VS Code** if you want a professional offline setup
    - Both are valid — learn both below and pick what fits you today

=== "🌐 Replit (Online)"

    **Setup time: ~2 minutes. Needs only a browser.**

    ---

    **Step 1 — Create a free account**

    Go to [replit.com](https://replit.com) and click **Sign Up**.
    Enter your email, choose a password, verify your email, log in.

    ---

    **Step 2 — Create your first project**

    1. Click **+ Create Repl**
    2. Search for `Python` in the template list
    3. Select **Python**
    4. Name it: `code-core-python`
    5. Click **Create Repl**

    ---

    **Step 3 — Understand the interface**

    | Panel | Purpose |
    |-------|---------|
    | Left | File explorer — your project files |
    | Centre | Code editor — write your code here |
    | Right | Console — output appears here when you run |

    ---

    **Step 4 — Run your first program**

    In the centre panel, type:

    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    print("I am learning Python!")
    ```

    Click the green **▶ Run** button.

    You should see the output on the right panel immediately. ✅

=== "🖥️ VS Code (Offline)"

    **Setup time: ~15 minutes. Works without internet after setup.**

    ---

    **Step 1 — Install Python**

    Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    and click the big yellow **Download Python 3.x.x** button.

    Run the installer.

    !!! danger "Windows — critical step"
        On the installer's **first screen**, tick the checkbox:
        **"Add Python to PATH"** — before clicking Install Now.
        Skipping this breaks everything and is the #1 beginner mistake.

    Verify installation — open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

    Expected output:
    ```
    Python 3.12.0
    ```

    If you see a version number — Python is installed. ✅

    ---

    **Step 2 — Install VS Code**

    Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com) and
    download for your operating system. Run the installer with all
    default settings.

    ---

    **Step 3 — Install the Python Extension**

    2. Click the **Extensions icon** in the left sidebar (four squares)
    3. Search: `Python`
    4. Click **Python by Microsoft** → Click **Install**
    5. Wait ~30 seconds

    ---

    **Step 4 — Create your project folder**

    1. Create a folder on your desktop named `code-core-python`
    2. In VS Code: **File → Open Folder** → Select that folder
    3. Click the **New File** icon → Name it `lesson01.py`

    ---

    **Step 5 — Run your file**

    Type your code in the editor, then open the terminal:
    **Terminal → New Terminal** and run:

    ```bash
    python lesson01.py
    ```

    ---

    **VS Code interface at a glance:**

    ```
    ┌─────────────┬──────────────────┬─────────────────┐
    │ Activity Bar│   Editor Area    │    Terminal      │
    │  (left side)│ (write code here)│ (output appears) │
    │             │                  │                  │
    │ 📁 Explorer │  lesson01.py     │ $ python ...     │
    │ 🔍 Search   │                  │ Hello, World!    │
    │ 🧩 Exts     │  print("Hello")  │                  │
    └─────────────┴──────────────────┴─────────────────┘
    ```

## 🛠️ Your First Program

Create a new file called `lesson01.py` and type this **exactly**
— do not copy-paste. Typing builds muscle memory.

```python title="lesson01.py" linenums="1"
# ================================
# My First Python Program
# ================================

print("Hello, World!")               # (1)
print("My name is [YOUR NAME]")      # (2)
print("I am learning Python!")       # (3)
```

1. `print()` displays text on the screen. Text must always be inside quotes.
2. Replace `[YOUR NAME]` with your actual name before running.
3. Every `print()` call outputs on its own new line automatically.

**Expected output:**

```
Hello, World!
My name is Arjun
I am learning Python!
```

!!! example "Try this"
    Add a fourth `print()` line that outputs your city name.
    Run it again. What changes in the output?

---

## 🏋️ Practice Exercise

!!! question "Exercise — My Python Introduction"

    Write a Python program with **at least 5 `print()` statements**
    that produces this output using your own real information:

    ```
    =============================
           MY INTRODUCTION
    =============================
    Name    : Arjun Sharma
    Age     : 14
    City    : Kathmandu, Nepal
    Hobby   : Playing football
    Goal    : Build a robot with Python
    =============================
    ```

    **Requirements:**

    - Border lines at top and bottom
    - Each piece of information on its own line
    - Labels aligned using spaces inside the quotes

    ??? tip "Hint — click to reveal"
        Use `print("=" * 29)` to generate the border automatically.
        Python repeats the `=` character 29 times for you.

        Each data line looks like:
        ```python
        print("Name    : Arjun Sharma")
        ```
        Just add spaces between the label and `:` to align them.

---

## 🔥 Challenge

!!! danger "Challenge — The Formatted Story"

    Write a program that prints a short personal story.

    **Requirements:**

    - A title inside a box built from `=` characters
    - At least 5 lines of story content
    - Sections separated by blank `print()` lines
    - At least one line using string repetition like `print("-" * 30)`

    **Example structure:**
    ```
    ==============================
          MY CODING STORY
    ==============================

    My name is Arjun. I live in Kathmandu, Nepal.
    I am 14 years old and I love technology.

    ------------------------------

    I started learning Python because I want to
    build robots and AI systems one day.

    ==============================
    ```

    **Extension ideas:**

    - Make the title box with `|` sides: `|   MY STORY   |`
    - Add a "Chapter 1" heading line before your story
    - Use `print()` to draw a simple picture using characters
